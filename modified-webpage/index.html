                celebrated and this year’s theme is “Beat Air Pollution”. We, humans, have lasted a devastating impact
                on the world’s air, which has started taking its toll on us. Now that media and social experts have
                started highlighting our tragic impact on air and with people dying from toxic air pollution, people
                have actually started noticing the importance and are trying to make changes in their lifestyle to

                Household air pollution which occurs due to the burning of cow dung, wood, and other biomass-based
                fuels, leads to around 3.8 million premature deaths, mostly in developing countries like India.
                Industrial and transport pollution is responsible for thousands of premature deaths worldwide annually.
                Around 24 percent of greenhouse gas emission worldwide comes from agriculture, forestry, and other
                land-use.
                Waste burning and dumping also release harmful dioxins, methane, and black carbon into the atmosphere
                while volcanic outbreaks, dust storms, and other natural processes also contribute to global air
                pollution.

                Here are some simple yet effective tips for protecting your family and you from the dangers of air
                pollution.
                While stepping out, check air pollution forecasts in your area.
                Avoid exercising outdoors when air pollution levels are high. Limit the amount of time you or your child
                spends playing outdoors if the air quality is bad.
                Always carry face mask which is also known as Anti-Pollution Mask with you.
                Try to use less electrical energy at home as generating electricity and various sources of energy
                creates air pollution.
                Avoid burning of wood and trash as it is one of the leading factors which cause air pollution.
                Avoid using personal vehicles for commuting. Use more of public transports or opt for carpool!
                Avoid the usage of air conditioners as they emit CFCs- Chlorofluorocarbons, which are the major reason
                for global warming and air pollution.
                We all as living beings have to understand that the environment is the most prominent thing; if we want
                to ensure better health and life to our coming generations. We all are not expected to do great things,
                but small changes in our lifestyle are enough to do our part. If we understand this and contribute our
                bit to the nature and environment, pollution and danger to the environment will become a thing of the
                past, and we will offer a better world to live in to our children.
